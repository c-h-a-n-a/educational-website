        <p class="text-lg text-gray-800 leading-relaxed">
           Campus journalism is the practice of journalism found in educational settings, usually in universities or secondary schools. Reporting on events, problems, and goings-on in the campus community is part of it; reports are frequently produced by student-run publications, magazines, blogs, or radio shows. Academic accomplishments, campus activities, athletics, culture, and student life are just a few of the many subjects covered by campus journalists. It provides a forum for students to hone their reporting, writing, and critical thinking abilities while informing the university community. When radio, television, and the Internet emerged in the 20th century, the term "journalism" was first used to refer to the reporting of current events in print, particularly in newspapers. However, its meaning expanded to encompass all printed and electronic communications that dealt with current affairs. The history of college journalism in the Philippines began with the publication of El Liliputiense by the University of Santo Tomas in 1890, according to The History of Journalism in the Philippine Islands (1933) and John Lent in the Philippine Mass Communication (1964). Campus journalism serves as a means of advancement for educational institutions in addition to being an activity that involves gathering, writing, and editing news items about the school for publications such as newspapers, magazines, radio, and television that are only available within the institution.
